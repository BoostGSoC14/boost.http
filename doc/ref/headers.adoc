[[headers]]
==== `headers`

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/http/headers.hpp>
----

`headers` is a simple typedef for some unspecified multimap container.

The user can safely assume that `headers::key_type` will be `std::string` and
`headers::mapped_type` will be `std::string`. `std::string` is used because
fulfills the requirements perfectly and is very unlikely it will ever cause any
controversy.

The user can also assume that this type fulfills the <<message_concept,Headers
definition of message>>.

NOTE: Previously, `headers` was guaranteed to be a typedef for
`boost::container::flat_multimap`.
