[[regex_router]]
==== `regex_router`

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/http/regex_router.hpp>
----

Router based on regular expressions.  It is implemented as a vector of
`pairs<regex,router>`.  Where `regex` is a std::regex that tests a specific path
received by a connection, and if matches, calls the `router` function with
an arbitary number of arguments.

The `router` is an arbitary function, that must match the call to the router
itself.  So if we call the route as `basic_router(path, arg1, arg2)` the `router`
function will be called with `router(arg1, arg2)`.

===== Template parameters

`route_function_type`::
    Functor of the route destination function.

`typename... arguments`::
    List of argument type to be passed onto the route destination function.
