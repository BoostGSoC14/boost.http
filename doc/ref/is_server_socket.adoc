[[is_server_socket]]
==== `is_server_socket`

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/http/traits.hpp>
----

If `T` is an object fulfilling the <<server_socket_concept,`ServerSocket`
concept>>, this template inherits `std::true_type`. For any other type, this
template inherits `std::false_type`.

This template may be specialized for a user-defined type to indicate that the
type is eligible for operations involving <<server_socket_concept,`ServerSocket`
objects>>.

Initially, it was considered to create a trait that would automatically detect
if `T` is fullfilling the <<server_socket_concept,`ServerSocket` concept>>, but
the idea was abandoned, because the <<server_socket_concept,`ServerSocket`
concept>> includes behaviour that can only be detected at runtime.

===== Template parameters

`T`::

  The type to query.
