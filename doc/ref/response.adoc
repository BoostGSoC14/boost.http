[[response]]
==== `response`

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/http/response.hpp>
----

`response` is a simple typedef for <<basic_response,`basic_response`>>. It's
defined as follows:

[source,cpp]
----
typedef basic_response<std::string, headers, std::vector<std::uint8_t>> response;
----

`std::vector<std::uint8_t>` is used over `std::string`, because fits the purpose
of the body (binary data payload container) better (no `'\0'` character
terminator, well-defined behaviours of capacity, size and iterator invalidation,
...).
