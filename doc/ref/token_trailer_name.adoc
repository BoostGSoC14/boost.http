[[token_trailer_name]]
==== `token::trailer_name`

namespace token {

struct trailer_name
{
    typedef boost::string_ref type;
    static const token::code::value code = token::code::trailer_name;
};

} // namespace token

[NOTE]
====
It's guaranteed that this token storage in the buffer (as extracted from
`token_size()` and offset) represents the trailer name exactly (i.e. if you
want, you can just use offset + size and ignore
`value<token::trailer_name>()`). This guarantee is used in the Boost.Http
message framework.

However, other implementations might not provide this guarantee (e.g. a draft of
this interface proposed to standardization). I still need to think more about
what to do here.
