[[is_message]]
==== `is_message`

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/http/traits.hpp>
----

If `T` is an object fulfilling the <<message_concept,`Message` concept>>, this
template inherits `std::true_type`. For any other type, this template inherits
`std::false_type`.

This template may be specialized for a user-defined type to indicate that the
type is eligible for operations involving <<message_concept,`Message` objects>>.

Initially, it was considered to create a trait that would automatically detect
if `T` is fullfilling the <<message_concept,`Message` concept>>, but the idea
was abandoned, because the <<message_concept,`Message` concept>> includes
behaviour that can only be detected at runtime.

===== Template parameters

`T`::

  The type to query.
