[[request]]
==== `request`

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/http/request.hpp>
----

`request` is a simple typedef for <<basic_request,`basic_request`>>. It's
defined as follows:

[source,cpp]
----
typedef basic_request<std::string, headers, std::vector<std::uint8_t>> request;
----

`std::vector<std::uint8_t>` is used over `std::string`, because fits the purpose
of the body (binary data payload container) better (no `'\0'` character
terminator, well-defined behaviours of capacity, size and iterator invalidation,
...).
