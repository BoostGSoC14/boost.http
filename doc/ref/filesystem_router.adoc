[[filesystem_router]]
==== `filesystem_router`

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/http/filesystem_router.hpp>
----

Router that tests a path received by a connection, and tests if `root` + `path`
exists on disk.  If it exists, calls the `router` function with an arbitary
number of arguments.

The `router` is an arbitary function, that must match the call to the router
itself.  So if we call the route as `basic_router(path, arg1, arg2)` the `router`
function will be called with `router(arg1, arg2)`.

===== Template parameters

`route_function_type`::
    Functor of the route destination function.

`typename... arguments`::
    List of argument type to be passed onto the route destination function.
