This library can be used to create applications that need to expose services
through HTTP (e.g. embeddable ReST services).

WARNING: This is not an official Boost C++ library. It wasn't reviewed and can't
be downloaded from
www.boost.org. http://www.boost.org/community/review_schedule.html[This library
will be reviewed eventually].

Conceptually Boost.Http is a Boost.Asio socket for HTTP, which means can
leverage Boost.Asio features such as SSL and coroutines, and it integrates
seemlessly with other Boost.Asio sockets.

Among its features:

* Support for modern HTTP features.
** Pipelining and persistent connection, where the same connection can be used
   to serve HTTP multiple requests.
** Chunking, where the HTTP body can be split into smaller pieces that are sent
   one by one. This is useful for building event listeners.
** Upgrading, where the HTTP protocol can be changed into another protocol such
   as WebSockets.
** Security, where SSL is used to encrypt the traffic.
** `100-continue` status.
* Lean API that unifies HTTP messages and HTTP chunking.
** You can handle the request as soon as the metadata is available (request line
   plus header section).
** There is only one API to acquire the request body. This API allows
   progressive downloading.
** The response body can be be generated wholesale for normal HTTP responses, or
   be split into smaller pieces using HTTP chunking.
* Extensible asynchronous design inherited from ASIO.
** Interaction via futures, coroutines, or callbacks.
** Various HTTP server architectures are possible, whether multi-threaded
   servers (one thread per request, either with or without a thread-pool), one
   coroutine per request, or completely single-threaded.
** Seamless integration with other non-HTTP ASIO services.

Boost.Http also provides a couple of special-purpose server classes:

* Lightweight standalone server.
** The underlying socket type is customizable, so you can also use a
   `queue_socket` footnote:[Useful to avoid the gotchas of ASIO composed
   operations. See http://sourceforge.net/p/asio/mailman/message/32259256/ for
   more information.]footnote:[See an example at
   <http://sourceforge.net/p/axiomq/code/ci/master/tree/include/axiomq/basic_queue_socket.hpp>.].
* Flexible static file server with support for conditional requests, partial
  download and ETag recognition.
** You can use the default file resolver or provide one yourself.
** You can adapt the default resolver.
** You can add a last hook to customize the response message before the file is
   served.
** Stateless abstractions, relying on OS capabilities to provide cache.

Boost.Http has been designed for multiple backends, such HTTP/2, and FastGCI,
which can be added in the future. You can choose between compile-time and
runtime polymorphism. Adapters are provided.
