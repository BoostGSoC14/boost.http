This library can be used to create applications that need to parse HTTP streams.

WARNING: This is not an official Boost C++ library. It wasn't reviewed and can't
be downloaded from www.boost.org. This library will be reviewed eventually.

''''

Boost.Http is a library that provides an incremental HTTP parser and a set of
mini-parsers that can be used independently or combined footnote:[parser
combinators algorithms are on the way to ease it up even
further. https://vimeo.com/171704565[Check the talk from Scott Wlaschin for
more].]. A future version will also provide a message generator.

The highlights are:

* Support for modern HTTP features.
* Simple.
* Portable (C++03 and very few other dependencies).
* Just like Ryan Dahl's HTTP parser, this parser does not make any syscalls or
  allocations. It also does not buffer data.
* You can mutate the passed buffer footnote:[The larger explanation being:
  incomplete tokens are kept in buffer, so you are not required to allocate them
  on a secondary buffer, but you're still allowed to mutate/move/grow the buffer
  (as opposed to... say... some C++ iterators that would get invalidated once
  the container changes).].
* It doesn't steal control flow from your application footnote:[parsing is done
  one token at a time no matter how much data is buffered]. Great for HTTP
  pipelining.
* Matching and decoding tokens as separate steps footnote:[Proper extraction of
  header fields (some popular parsers like NodeJS's will force you to know
  protocol details and parser internals to manually remove leading and trailing
  whitespace from field values). This point is not only about header field
  extraction, but really about a parser that indeed abstract and understand the
  protocol and that is easy to use right by people that don't know HTTP.].
