=== Implementing Boost.Beast parser interface

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to implement Boost.Beast parser interface
using Boost.Http parser.

NOTE: No prior experience with Boost.Beast is required.

Boost.Beast parser borrows much of its design from Ryan Dahl's HTTP parser ‚Äî the
NodeJS parser. This is a design that I do know and used more than once in
different projects. However, this is not the only design I know of. I see much
of this design as an evolution of the language limitations that you find in the
C language.

https://vinipsmaker.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/boost-http-has-a-new-parser/[I've
previously written a few complaints about the Ryan Dahl's HTTP
parser]. Boost.Beast evolves from this design and takes a few different
decisions. We'll see if, and which, limitations the Boost.Beast parser still
carries thanks to this inheritance.

==== Learning how to use the parser

The parser is represented by a `basic_parser<isRequest, Derived>` class. The
parser is callback-based just like Ryan Dahl's HTTP parser and it uses CRTP to
avoid the overhead of virtual function calls.

[NOTE]
.DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
====
And here we can notice the first difference between Boost.Beast and Boost.Http
parsers.

If you design an algorithm to work on the parser object, this algorithm must be
a template (and it carries the same drawbacks of a header-only library):

[source,cpp]
----
template<Derived>
void do_stuff(boost::beast::http::basic_parser<true, Derived> o);
----

But if you use Boost.Http parser, this requirement vanishes:

[source,cpp]
----
void do_stuff(boost::http::reader::request o);
----
====

To feed the parser with data, you call `basic_parser::put`:

[source,cpp]
----
template<
    class ConstBufferSequence>
std::size_t
put(
    ConstBufferSequence const& buffers,
    error_code& ec);
----

The parser will match *and* decode the tokens in the stream.

[NOTE]
.DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
====
Match and decoding are always applied together. What does this mean? Not much,
given decoding HTTP/1.1 tokens is cheap and most of the time it reduces to
return a `string_view` of the associated buffer region.

However, the implications of the fundamental model chosen (pull or push) give
rise to larger divergences at this point already.

In the Boost.Beast parser, the token is passed to the function callback
registered. In the Boost.Http parser, the token is hold by the parser object
itself.

It might not seem much difference at the first glance, but consider the problem
of composability. If I want to write an algorithm to take a
`boost::http::reader::request` object to read a `field_name` token and possibly
skip it together with the associated `field_value` (maybe that field isn't of
your interest), you only need to wrap the parser object if you're using the
Boost.Http solution footnote:[If I continue to develop the Boost.Http's message
framework, that's the solution that will be adopted to this particular
problem.]. As for the Boost.Beast parser, you're left with a long and hackishy
inheritance chain that I don't even want to imagine right now if you were to
compose the algorithms.

Just as a concrete illustration of what I meant by the Boost.Http solution:

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T /* = http::reader::request */>
void socket_consumer<T>::parse(asio::buffer buf) { /* ... */ }

http::token::code::value my_parser_wrapper::code() const
{
    return code_;
}

void my_parser_wrapper::next()
{
    // Here I should use a case-insensitive comparison function.
    // For simplicity, this step is omitted.

    wrapped_parser.next();
    code_ = wrapped_parser.code();
    if (code_ == code::field_name
        && (wrapped_parser.value<token::field_name>()
            == "connection")) {
        code_ = code::skip;
        skip_next_value = true;
    } else if (code_ == code::field_value
               && skip_next_value) {
        code_ = code::skip;
        skip_next_value = false;
    }
}
----

How would the solution look like using the Boost.Beast parser? Let's draft
something:

[source,cpp]
----
template<class Derived>
class my_parser_wrapper
    : public basic_parser<true, my_parser_wrapper<Derived>>
{
public:
    void
    on_field_impl(field f, string_view name, string_view value, error_code& ec)
    {
        // Here I should use a case-insensitive comparison function.
        // For simplicity, this step is omitted.

        if (name == "connection") {
            return;
        }

        static_cast<Derived&>(*this).on_field_impl(f, name, value, ec);
    }

    void on_header_impl(error_code& ec)
    {
        static_cast<Derived&>(*this).on_header_impl(ec);
    }

    // ...
};

template<template <typename> class parser>
class custom_parser
    : public parser<custom_parser>
{
    // Here we have our original handler.
    // It'd be our `my_socket_consumer` from the Boost.Http example.
};

custom_parser<my_parser_wrapper>;
----

However, this solution is fully flawed. As `my_parser_wrapper` inherits directly
from `basic_parser`, we cannot inject some `my_parser_wrapper2` which applies
another transformation in the chain.

I can't emphasize enough that the problem is *not* about adding a
‚Äúskip-this-set-of-HTTP-headers‚Äù function. The problem is about a fundamental
building block which can solve more of the user needs. I could keep thinking
about the different problems that could happen, but if you do not give a *try*
to enter in the _general_ problem and insist on a _myopic vision_, you'll
*never* grasp my message (just as an addicted to inductive reasoning will never
understand someone who is using deductive reasoning). If all you have is a
hammer, everything looks like a nail. We shall see more design implications
later on as we continue this chapter.
====

As the tokens are found, the user callbacks are called. The function returns the
number of parsed bytes.

[NOTE]
.DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
====
And as each sentence goes on, it seems that I need to explain more design
implications.

What if you want to __reject__ messages as soon as one specific token is found?
The point here is about avoiding unnecessary computation of parsing elements of
a message that would be rejected anyway.


For Boost.Http parser, the control flow is yours to take and...

[quote, Aleister Crowley]
____
*Do what thou wilt* shall be the whole of the Law.
____

A concrete example if you may:

[source,cpp]
----
// ...

case code::field_value:
    if (last_header_was_x && is_good(reader.value<token::field_value>())) {
        // stop the world (e.g. `return` or `throw`)
    }

// ...
----

As for Boost.Beast parser. There *is* an answer, but not with your current
limited knowledge of the API. Let's continue to present Boost.Beast API and come
back at this ‚Äústop the world‚Äù problem later.
====

The behaviour usually found in push parsers is to parse the stream until the end
of the feeded buffers and then return. This is the NodeJS's parser approach from
which Boost.Beast takes much inspiration. However, Boost.Beast takes a slightly
different approach to this problem so it's possible to parse only one token at a
time. The Boost.Beast solution is the `eager` function:

[source,cpp]
----
void
eager(
    bool v);
----

[quote, Vinnie Falco, Boost.Beast documentation]
____
Normally the parser returns after successfully parsing a structured element
(header, chunk header, or chunk body) even if there are octets remaining in the
input. This is necessary when attempting to parse the header first, or when the
caller wants to inspect information which may be invalidated by subsequent
parsing, such as a chunk extension. The eager option controls whether the parser
keeps going after parsing structured element if there are octets remaining in
the buffer and no error occurs. This option is automatically set or cleared
during certain stream operations to improve performance with no change in
functionality.

The default setting is `false`.
____

[NOTE]
.DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
====
And now, back at the ‚Äústop the world‚Äù problem...

Simply put, Boost.Beast solution is just a hackishy way to implement a pull
parser ‚Äî the parser approach _consciously_ chosen by Boost.Http parser.

Alternatively, you can just set the `error_code& ec` on the callback
implementation to stop parsing, but this wouldn't solve all the use cases (the
reason why `eager` is provided).
====

Continuing this inductive reasoning of ‚Äúhey! a problem appeared, let's write yet
another function, `function_xyz`, to solve use case 777‚Äù, a number of other
functions are provided. One of them is `header_limit`:

[source,cpp]
----
void
header_limit(
    std::uint32_t v);
----

[quote, Vinnie Falco, Boost.Beast documentation]
____
This function sets the maximum allowed size of the header including all field
name, value, and delimiter characters and also including the CRLF sequences in
the serialized input. If the end of the header is not found within the limit of
the header size, the error `http::header_limit` is returned by
`http::basic_parser::put`.

Setting the limit after any header octets have been parsed results in undefined
behavior.
____

Another function, `body_limit`, is provided in the same spirit of
`header_limit`. What if I have a use case to limit `request-target` size? Then
Boost.Beast author will add `function_xyz2` to use case 778.

[NOTE]
.DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
====
What is the Boost.Http solution to this problem ü§î? This is broken into two
possible cases.

1. The whole token is in the buffer: In such case you just need to check
   `token_size`.
2. The buffer has been exhausted and no token is there: Here, just check
   `expected_token`.

It'll work for *any* token (i.e. you don't need one extra function for each
possible token which would just complicate the implementation and inflate the
object with a large `Settings` object of some sort).
====

With all this info, the Boost.Beast parser is mostly covered and we can delve
into the implementation of such interface.

[NOTE]
.DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
====
Now... let's look at something different. Suppose the following scenario:

You have an embedded project and the headers must not be stored (as it'd imply
heap memory of complex data structures). You process options with an in situ
algorithm out from the headers. In Boost.Http parser, I'm imagining something in
these lines:

[source,cpp]
----
enum last_header_code {
    OUT_OF_INTEREST_SET,
    FOO,
    BAR,
    FOOBAR
};

// ...

case code::field_name:
    {
        auto v = reader.value<token::field_name>();
        if (iequals(v, "foo")) {
            last_header = FOO;
        } else if (iequals(v, "bar")) {
            last_header = BAR;
        } else if (iequals(v, "foobar")) {
            last_header = FOOBAR;
        } else {
            last_header = OUT_OF_INTEREST_SET;
        }
        break;
    }
case code::field_value:
    if (last_header == FOO) {
        foo = process_foo(reader.value<token::field_value>());
    } else if (last_header == BAR) {
        bar = process_bar(reader.value<token::field_value>());
    } else if (last_header == FOOBAR) {
        foobar = process_foobar(reader.value<token::field_value>());
    }
    break;

// ...
----

Boost.Beast solution is not hard to imagine too:

[source,cpp]
----
// ...

void on_field_impl(field, string_view name, string_view value, error_code& ec)
{
    if (iequals(name, "foo")) {
        foo = process_foo(value);
    } else if (iequals(name, "bar")) {
        bar = process_bar(value);
    } else if (iequals(name, "foobar")) {
        foobar = process_foobar(value);
    }
}

// ...
----

So... what does each design _implies_? As Boost.Beast parser always parse field
name + field value _together_, if both fields sum up more than the buffer size,
you're out of luck. Both tokens must fit in the buffer together.

Just as an exercise, let's pursue the inductive reasoning applied to this
problem. We _could_ split the Boost.Beast's `on_field_impl` callback into two:

[source]
----
void
on_field_name_impl(
    field f,
    string_view name,
    error_code& ec);

void
on_field_value_impl(
    string_view value,
    error_code& ec);
----

But then we create another problem:

[quote, Vinnie Falco, Boost.Beast documentation]
____
[...] it is the responsibility of the derived class to copy any information it
needs before returning from the callback [...]
____

If you don't see a problem already, let me unveil it for you. Now, most of the
uses of the parser, which want to store the HTTP headers in some sort of
`std::multimap` structure will have to perform one extra allocation:

[source,cpp]
----
void on_field_name_impl(field, string_view name, error_code& ec)
{
    last_header = to_string(name);
}
----

Under the push parser model, these two cases are irreconcilable. Boost.Beast
opts to solve the most common problem and this was a good design choice (let's
give credit where credit is due).

However, Boost.Http parser is a good choice in _any_ of these two cases. It only
feeds one token at a time. And as Boost.Http message framework demonstrate,
https://github.com/BoostGSoC14/boost.http/blob/c7b3e11884420b55568222d237e9c429ec24b811/include/boost/http/socket-inl.hpp#L630[we
can use the first bytes of the buffer to store the HTTP field name].

And just to present a more readable alternative, you could play with copies of
the reader object made in the stack of the
`my_socket_consumer::on_socket_callback` function. This way, you have a point in
time and you can make the parser ‚Äúgo back‚Äù. The copies are cheap because the
reader object is just an integer-based state machine with a few indexes. The
_idea_ behind this solution is to mirror current Boost.Beast behaviour ‚Äî field
name and field value are always kept together in the buffer.

*Remember*... principles. I can attack other specific cases. As an exercise, try
to find a few yourself.
====

==== Implementing the Boost.Beast interface

[NOTE]
====
As we previously seen, there are several functions in Boost.Beast parser that
are just boilerplate inherited (e.g. `eager`) thanks to the choice of the wrong
fundamental model (i.e. pull vs push).

We'll skip some of this boilerplate as it is not of our interest. Our purpose
with this tutorial was to show design implications derived from the choices of
the _fundamental_ models.
====

[source,cpp]
----
template<bool isRequest, class Derived>
class basic_parser;

// This template specialization is wrong, but is kept for simplification
// purposes.
template<bool isRequest, class Derived>
class basic_parser<true, Derived>
{
public:
    template<
        class ConstBufferSequence>
    std::size_t
    put(
        ConstBufferSequence const& buffers,
        error_code& ec)
    {
        // WARNING: the real implementation will have more trouble because of
        // the `ConstBufferSequence` concept, but for the reason of simplicity,
        // we don't show the real code here.
        reader.set_buffer(buffers);

        error_code ec;

        do {
            reader.next();
            switch (reader.code()) {
            case code::skip:
                break;
            case code::method:
                method = reader.value<token::method>;
                break;
            case code::request_target:
                target = reader.value<token::request_target>;
                break;
            case code::version:
                static_cast<Derived&>(*this)
                    .on_request_impl(/*the enum code*/, method, target,
                                     reader.value<token::version>(), ec);
                if (ec) {
                    // TODO: extra code to enter in error state
                    return reader.parsed_count();
                }
                break;

            // ...

            case code::end_of_headers:
                static_cast<Derived&>(*this).on_header_impl(ec);
                if (ec) {
                    // TODO: extra code to enter in error state
                    return reader.parsed_count();
                }
                break;

            // ...
            }
        } while (reader.code() != code::error_insufficient_data);

        return reader.parsed_count();
    }

private:
    boost::http::reader::request reader;

    // It's possible and easy to create an implementation that doesn't allocate
    // memory. Just keep a copy of `reader` within the `put` function body and
    // you can go back. As `reader` is just an integer-based state machine with
    // a few indexes, the copy is cheap. I'm sorry I don't have the time to code
    // the demonstration right now.
    std::string method;
    std::string target;
};
----

A final note I want to add is that I plan more improvements to the parser. Just
as Boost.Beast parser is an evolution of the wrong model chosen for the problem,
my parser still has room to _evolve_. But from my judgment, this parser already
is better than Boost.Beast parser can ever be (i.e. the problems I presented
here are unfixable in Boost.Beast design... not to mention that Boost.Beast
parser has almost the double amount of member-functions to solve _the same_
problem footnote:[Consult Occam's razor.]).
