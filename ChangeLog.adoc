= ChangeLog

You can check any breaking changes here.

== v0.6

* Port code to Boost 1.70.
** I/O object constructor overloads that reference `io_context` directly were
   removed. These constructors were present to adhere to the informal contract
   that `io_context` is always the first parameter (take `steady_timer`
   constructors for instance). These overloads were adding complexity not worth
   keeping. I might change my mind later if requested.
** Using `async_initiate` everywhere.

== v0.5

* Ensure `ServerSocket`'s `read_state` is `read_state::finished` once a request
  is read. Previously this was `read_state::empty`. Go change your loop to wait
  while `socket.read_state() != read_state::finished`.
* Boost requirement raised to 1.66.
* New `BOOST_HTTP_SOCKET_DEFAULT_BODY_COPY_THRESHOLD` macro.
* Add `poly_handler<F>` alternative to `std::function<F>`.
* Rewrite runtime-based polymorphic helpers.
** Names go from `polymorphic_*` to `poly_*`.
** Use `poly_handler<F>` instead `std::function<F>`.
** Add polymorphic helpers for `ClientSocket`.
* Add `socket::async_{read,write}_chunkext`.
* Remove `async_read_trailers()`. This function added no value.
* `http_errc` and `file_server_errc` are no longer error conditions.
